# 3D-models_Square_Designe
I develope Simple 3D-models by using Python Programming and its Library.

I used Turtle Module for this project.
Turtle module is used for Graphics designe.

Then, 
I used randint function from random module. The randint Python function is a built-in method that lets you generate random integers and returns an integer number selected element from the specified range.

after that I used speed for manage speed of turtle.

Then, for Background color i used bgcolor and color used black

Then,
I create a variable X=1, for loop.

After that, while x < 500: it will run till 500 pixel of size of your screen window.

Then, I used randint for color variation by r g b color model.

After that, I used colormode. It used for color contrast setting.

Then, pencolor used as a argumet(r,g,b) for butify by changing in multiple color.

Then, I used forward function as fd. I take fd(50+x) uses for every time the sqare will made increase with 50 in size. Then right used as rt.

Then, increment value with 1

Finally, 
I call exitonclic. Basically it used for exit.

Thankyou.
